# 📱 My_App

A simple and modern Flutter application created as part of my **Internship Task ** at **Developers Hub**.  
This project demonstrates how to build a login screen, validate forms, and navigate between screens using Flutter.

---

## 🧾 Project Overview
This app is designed to fulfill the internship requirements for basic Flutter development:
1. Create a login screen with email and password fields.
2. Add a “Forgot Password?” text.
3. Use widgets like `Column`, `Row`, and `Container` for layout.
4. Validate form fields for email and password.
5. Navigate from Login Screen → Home Screen using `Navigator.push()`.
